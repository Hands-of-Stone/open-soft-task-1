# **PROBLEM STATEMENT** : 
  ###ROOM ALLOCATION

###Design a room booking system to allocate and view rooms of students in a hall in IIT Kharagpur.

#**SKILLS**:
###HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, SQL, Python, Flask/Django

#**INSTRUCTIONS**:

###Create a Room booking system using Flask/Django and SQL/MongoDB.
###When we open the web app, the login page should appear(if the user is not already logged in). If he has not yet registered, a button for sign-up should be present to ###direct him to the signup page.
###The user will sign up(register) for the first time and enter details like his roll no.,  phone no and account password.
###After signing-up is complete, redirect the user to the login page.
###After successfully logging in, the home page appears, which represents the allocation of rooms.
###The allocation may be represented by a grid of boxes with room numbers written over them.
###The rooms already allocated can be represented by red and rest by green.
###If the user clicks a green room, its color should change to red.
###Now whenever the user logs in, he must directly land on this home page, with his allocated room in red showing his name.

###Consider all the rooms as single sharing.
